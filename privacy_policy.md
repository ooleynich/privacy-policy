### Game Center

Apple Inc. is the provider of the Game Center service, which permits you to engage in game related activities, including, but not limited to, participation in leader boards, multi-player games, and tracking achievements. The Service may not be available in all areas. Use of the Service requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors.

As set out in the Privacy Policy, when you use the Service, such as inviting other users to join the Service, participating in leader boards, enabling invitations or multiplayer functionality, or displaying status messages, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit. When playing a game that supports multiplayer functionality, other users accessing the Service from within the same game on the same Wi-Fi network, local area network or within range of Bluetooth will be able to see that you are nearby (unless you turn this feature off), and see your nickname and photo, or full profile if you have a friend relationship with such user. If you choose to have your public profile set to “on”, other users of the Service can see your full profile, including your full name, activity (such as the games you have played and when you played them), scores, and achievements, and you can be recommended as a friend to other users. If your public profile is set to “off”, only users with whom you have established a friend relationship can see your full profile, and you will not be recommended to others; only your nickname and photo will be visible to users who are not friends. If you send or receive a friend request, the full name associated with your Apple ID will be shared with those users to whom you send, or from whom you accept, a friend request, and Apple may recommend games that you have played to your friends.

### Yandex Metrica

Yandex Metrica a free web analytics service provided by Yandex that tracks and reports on all traffic that passes through your website or app. It also allow you to review the performance of your online ad campaigns by tracking site visits, conversion rates, and other key metrics.

Yandex Metrica mainly uses first-party cookies to report on visitor (aka. user) interactions on Yandex Metrica customers’ websites. Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie.

In addition, Yandex Metrica supports an optional browser add-on that - once installed and enabled - disables measurement by Yandex Metrica for any site a user visits. Note that this add-on only disables Yandex Metrica measurement.

Where a site or app uses Yandex Metrica for Apps, Yandex Metrica collects an app-instance identifier — a randomly generated number that identifies a unique installation of an App. Whenever a user resets their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID on Android, and ID for Advertisers on iOS), the app-instance identifier is also reset.

Where sites or apps have implemented Yandex Metrica with other Yandex Advertising products, like Yandex Ads, additional advertising identifiers may be collected. Users can opt-out of this feature and manage their settings for this cookie using the Ads Settings.

Yandex Metrica also collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give website owners a sense of which country, state, or city in the world their users come from (also known as "IP geolocation"). Yandex Metrica provides a method to mask IPs that are collected (detailed below) but note that website owners have access to their users’ IP addresses even if the website owners do not use Yandex Metrica.

Yandex uses Yandex Metrica data to provide the Yandex Analytics measurement service to customers. Identifiers such as cookies and app instance IDs are used to measure user interactions with a customer’s sites and/or apps, while IP addresses are used to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give the customer a sense of where in the world their users come from.
